# Custom Scanio Build

This page describes the available targets and variables in the [`Makefile`](../../scripts/custom-build/Makefile). This [`Makefile`](../../scripts/custom-build/Makefile) supports custom deployments of Scanio, including cases where users have their own versions of Scanio, plugins, and custom rule sets. The deployment process includes cloning the Scanio repository, applying custom rules, building rules, creating Docker images, and pushing them to a registry. 

For the more info, refer to [Makefile Custom Build](../../docs/reference/makefile-custom-build.md) reference.
