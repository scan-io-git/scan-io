# Rule Set Builder

This Python script automates the process of building rule sets for the Scanio Orchestrator based on a YAML configuration file. The script is designed to:
- Parse a given YAML configuration (`scanio_rules.yaml`).
- Clone multiple repositories as defined in a YAML configuration file.
- Copy specific files from the repositories into structured folders within a rules directory.
- Supports interactive and non-interactive directory cleanup.

For the more info, refer to [Rule Set Builder](../../docs/reference/rule-set-builder.md) reference.
