# Bandit Plugin
The Bandit plugin provides integration with the [Bandit scanner](https://github.com/PyCQA/bandit) within Scanio. It enables flexible execution of Bandit scans as part of CI/CD workflows or manual security audits.

This plugin supports analyzing single projects or multiple repositories (via input from the `list` command), allowing configuration customization and fine-tuning scan execution with Bandit-specific arguments.

You may find information regarding the plugin on [Banidt Plugin](/docs/reference/plugin-bandit.md) reference article.
