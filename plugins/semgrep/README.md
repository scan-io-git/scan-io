# Semgrep Plugin
The Semgrep plugin provides integration with the Semgrep scanner within Scanio. It enables flexible execution of Semgrep scans as part of CI/CD workflows or manual security audits.

This plugin supports analyzing single projects or multiple repositories (via input from the `list` command), allowing configuration customization and fine-tuning scan execution with Semgrep-specific arguments.
