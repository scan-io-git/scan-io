# Scan-io Cursor Rules

## Development workflow
- When implementing new features or making changes to the codebase, always check the `docs/engineering/` directory first for established patterns and guidelines:
- When in doubt about implementation details, always refer to the engineering documentation first, then examine similar existing implementations in the codebase.

## Commands
- Build cli with: `make build-cli`
- Build plugins with: `make build-plugins`
- Build everything with: `make build`
- Test with: `make test`
- Use `go fmt` for formatting

## Code style
- Use early returns when handling errors or special cases to reduce nesting and improve readability.
