# Scan-io Cursor Rules

## Development workflow
- When implementing new features or making changes to the codebase, always check the `docs/engineering/` directory first for established patterns and guidelines:
- When in doubt about implementation details, always refer to the engineering documentation first, then examine similar existing implementations in the codebase.
- Try to reuse internal packages if relevant. Extend if required functionality does not exist.
- Don't use `data` folder in tests, it will not be available in other environment. But feel free to read content to make proper mocks.

## Commands
- Build cli with: `make build-cli`
- Build plugins with: `make build-plugins`
- Build everything with: `make build`
- Test with: `make test`
- Use `go fmt` for formatting

## Code style
- Use early returns when handling errors or special cases to reduce nesting and improve readability.

## Planning
- When generating a plan for new features, refactoring and so on, make an analysis of codebase, then write a plan in phases.
- The plan may contain one or more phases. Each phase contains tasks. Write inputs and deliverables for each phase, task or group of tasks.
- Ensure that new functionality has tasks related to having tests for that functionality.
- Default plan file is `PLAN.md` in the root.
