# How to Build Scanio

This guide explains how to build the Scanio CLI, its plugins, and optional Docker image using the provided `Makefile`. There are two supported ways to build it, depending on your needs:

- Build a Docker container for an easy, isolated setup with all dependencies pre-installed. It's recommended way!
- Build a Go binary from the source code.

    - [Build Scanio Core Separately](#build-scanio-core-separately)
    - [Build Scanio Plugins Separately](#build-scanio-plugins-separately)

## Prerequisites

Ensure the following dependencies are installed on your system before building Scanio:

- [Go Programming Language](https://go.dev/doc/install)
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) (optional, for Docker image build)
- [jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/download/) (required for plugin builds)

Scanioâ€™s Makefile automatically checks for missing dependencies and provides an error message if anything is missing.

You should clone the code from the repo as the first step for any options:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/scan-io-git/scan-io
cd scan-io
```

## Option 1: Build Docker Image

If you want a fully containerized version of Scanio with all dependencies bundled:

```bash
make docker

# Sample output:
Build local Docker image (no registry push)...
docker build -t scanio .
[+] Building 34.8s (31/31) FINISHED   
 => [internal] ... 
```

This command will build a local Docker image called `scanio:latest`.

> [!TIP]
> You can customize the image name by setting the `IMAGE_NAME` and `REGISTRY` variables.

If you need to specify a registry and a version:
```bash
make docker-build VERSION=1.2 REGISTRY=my.registry.com/scanio

# Sample output:
make docker-build VERSION=1.2 REGISTRY=my.registry.com/scanio
Building Docker image for linux/amd64...
docker build --build-arg TARGETOS=linux --build-arg TARGETARCH=amd64 --platform=linux/amd64 \
        -t my.registry.com/scanio/scanio:1.2 -t my.registry.com/scanio/scanio:latest . || exit 1
[+] Building 34.8s (31/31) FINISHED  
 => [internal]
```

Push built images to a Docker registry:
```bash
make docker-push REGISTRY=my.registry.com/scanio VERSION=1.2

# Sample output:
Pushing Docker image to my.registry.com/scanio...
docker push my.registry.com/scanio/scanio:1.2 || exit 1
The push refers to repository [my.registry.com/scanio/scanio]
```

## Option 2: Build Scanio Core and Plugins Binaries

> [!NOTE]  
> Unlike the Docker version, the Go binary does not include dependencies for plugins. You must install these dependencies manually as described in the [plugin documentation](../reference/README.md#plugins).

To build a core CLI and plugin at once, use:
```bash
make build

# Sample output:
make build
Building Scanio core...
go build -ldflags="-X 'github.com/scan-io-git/scan-io/cmd/version.CoreVersion=1.0.0' \
                           -X 'github.com/scan-io-git/scan-io/cmd/version.GolangVersion=go1.23.4' \
                           -X 'github.com/scan-io-git/scan-io/cmd/version.BuildTime=2025-01-01T12:00:00Z'" \
           -o ~/.local/bin/scanio . || exit 1
Scanio core built successfully!
Building Scanio plugins...
Building plugin 'bandit' (v0.0.1, type: scanner)
...
All Scanio plugins built successfully!
```

Verify installation:
```bash
scanio --version

# Sample output:
scanio version
Core Version: v1.0.0
Plugin Versions:
...
  bandit: v0.0.1 (Type: scanner)
...
Go Version: go1.23.4
Build Time: 2025-01-01T12:00:00Z
```

In this scenario the CLI core binary is intalled into `~/.local/bin/scanio`, plugins are into `~/.scanio/plugins/`.

### Build Scanio Core CLI Separately 
If you need to build the core CLI only, use:

```bash
make build-cli

# Sample output:
Building Scanio core...
go build -ldflags="-X 'github.com/scan-io-git/scan-io/cmd/version.CoreVersion=1.0.0' \
                           -X 'github.com/scan-io-git/scan-io/cmd/version.GolangVersion=go1.23.4' \
                           -X 'github.com/scan-io-git/scan-io/cmd/version.BuildTime=2025-01-01T12:00:00Z'" \
           -o ~/.local/bin/scanio . || exit 1
Scanio core built successfully!
```

The binary will be saved by default to:
```
~/.local/bin/scanio
```

You can customize the target location by setting the `CORE_BINARY` variable:
```bash
make build-cli CORE_BINARY=/path/to//scanio
```

## Build Scanio Plugins Separately

> [!NOTE]  
> Unlike the Docker version, the Go binary does not include dependencies for plugins. You must install these dependencies manually as described in the [plugin documentation](../reference/README.md#plugins).

Plugins are built separately and saved into a structured plugin directory.

Build plugins only:

```bash
make build-plugins

# Sample output:
Building Scanio plugins...
Building plugin 'bandit' (v0.0.1, type: scanner)
...
All Scanio plugins built successfully!
```

By default, plugins are installed into:
```
~/.scanio/plugins/
```

You can customize the plugin directory path using by setting the `PLUGINS_DIR` variable::
```bash
make build-plugins PLUGINS_DIR=/path/to/plugin_folder/
```
