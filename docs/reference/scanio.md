### Folder Structure and Usage

Scanio uses several directories to manage configurations, plugins, artifacts, results, and temporary files. These directories can be customized via the `scanio` directive in the configuration file or through environment variables.

| Folder Name     | Default Path                  | Description                                                                                     |
|------------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `home_folder`    | `~/.scanio/`                 | The root directory for all Scanio operations.                                                  |
| `plugins_folder` | `{home_folder}/plugins`      | Directory for Scanio plugins and metadata.                                                     |
| `projects_folder`| `{home_folder}/projects`     | Stores project-specific files, organized by VCS domain and namespace.                          |
| Cloned repository path | `{home_folder}/projects/<VCS_domain>/<namespace_name>/<repository_name>/`     | Cloned repository will be placed by following this structure on a disk.                          |
| `results_folder` | `{home_folder}/results`      | Stores scan results.  |
| Analyse cmd result path | `{home_folder}/results/<VCS_domain>/<namespace_name>/<repository_name>/<scanning_result_file>`      | Results from scanners will be stored here. This default behavior applies only if the user does not explicitly provide a custom path to store the results. |
| `temp_folder`    | `{home_folder}/tmp`          | Temporary workspace used by pull-request fetches (diff artifacts, helper files). |
| `artifacts_folder`    | `{home_folder}/artifacts`          | Directory for CI artifacts files.    |
| PR diff path    | `{home_folder}/tmp/<VCS_domain>/<namespace_name>/<repository_name>/scanio-pr-tmp/<pr_id>/diff` | Diff-mode artifacts (e.g., sparse files from `--diff`) are stored here; the full repository checkout lives under `projects_folder`. |
| `logger.folder_path` | `{home_folder}/log`    | Path to a log file directory. Default: `{home_folder}/log`.                                        |


All files are placed under scanio home folder:
```
~/.scanio
|-- project/
    `-- github.com/
        `-- scan-io/
        |   `-- scan-io/
|-- results/
    `-- github.com/
        `-- scan-io/
        |   `-- scan-io/
|-- artifacts/
|-- log/
    `-- scanio.log
|-- tmp/
|-- plugins/
    |-- github/
    |-- gitlab/
    |-- semgrep/
    `-- trufflehog/
`-- config.yml
```
