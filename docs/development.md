### Vagrant
Vagrant allows to create reproducible development environment. This tool is especially handy for Windows-based developers.  
If you are not familiar with Vagrant, review ["Vagrant introduction" tutorial](https://developer.hashicorp.com/vagrant/tutorials/getting-started/getting-started-index) first, and optionally other Vagrant [documentation](https://developer.hashicorp.com/vagrant/docs) sections. The introduction tutorial will also explain how to setup the environment with VirtualBox.   
Most common commands to use with Vagrant:  
```bash
# create/provision/start the virtual machine
vagrant up
# connect to the machine
vagrant ssh
# destroy the machine
vagrant destroy
```
